# Sendy Pick-up Delivery Time Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop an ML model that can predict the time from pickup to delivery.


# Project Description
The need for global logistics services has increased dramatically and become extremely complex and dynamic as a result of a number of changes in manufacturing and in industrial production. In response, the logistics industry is changing in a variety of ways, including mergers to form integrated transportation service providers, outsourcing and increased use of information technology.

Specific emphasis will be given to the role of Internet-based applications. Within this context, the chapter introduces the need to understand what it takes to make estimate the pick-up delivery time.

The dataset provided by Sendy includes order details and rider metrics based on orders made on the Sendy platform. The challenge is to predict the estimated time of arrival for orders- from pick-up to drop-off.

Sendy provides an API as well as a web and mobile application platform to link customers who have delivery needs with vetted transporters. The customers select their vehicle of choice, get their price quote upfront and pay using various payment options. The system optimises the route, looks for the closest available riders and dispatches the orders in the most efficient way.

The training dataset provided here is a subset of over 20,000 orders and only includes direct orders (i.e. Sendy “express” orders) with bikes in Nairobi. All data in this subset have been fully anonymized while preserving the distribution.
